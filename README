# Mini Cpp Compiler 

### QuickStart

> 1. The source program should be written at test.input.c
> 2. Use <b>make test</b> for testing the compiler.
> 3. All production rules are defined at parser/parser.cpp.

### Features:

> 1. Handcrafted scanner.
> 2. Rule-action style LR(1) parser.
> 3. Tree representation of program and statics checker with graceful error handling.

### ToDos:

> 1. Single-inheritance classes and dynamic dispatch.
> 2. Support other primitive datatypes such as bool, float and char.
> 3. LLVM IR, RISC-V backend and intermediate code optimizer.
> 4. Overloading and type inference.
