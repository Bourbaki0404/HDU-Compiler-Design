# Mini Cpp Compiler 

### QuickStart

> 1. The source program should be written at test.input.c
> 2. Use <b>make test</b> for testing the compiler.
> 3. All production rules are defined at parser/parser.cpp.

### Features:

> 1. Handcrafted scanner.
> 2. Rule-action style LR(1) parser with conflict resolution.
> 3. Tree representation of program and statics checker with graceful error handling.
> 4. Support preliminary oop and pointer type.
> 5. LLVM-IR for intermediate codeGen.

### ToDos:

> 1. Class inheritance and dynamic dispatch.
> 2. Support other primitive datatypes such as bool, float and char.
> 3. RISC-V backend, static analyzer and intermediate code optimizer.
> 4. Function overloading and type inference.
> 5. Automatic memory management (garbage collection) for objects (specified by programmer).
> 6. More syntatic support like typedef, lambda expression or namespace.
